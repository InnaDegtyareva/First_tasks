In solitudes society
The evil breeds, autocracy
The fall of man, no son of God
Can tame the flames, welcome to Hell

Oh Lucifer, almighty one
The overlord of Babylon
Apostles' creed, the demon seed
The mammon rules the misery

At the final battle
On the first day of war
Where angels die, and legends rise
Only one man survives

Serve in heaven or reign in hell
Find your Paradise Lost
Rise, awake or forever be
Fallen in the abyss
The purge of God, banished to Hell
Angelic hordes and a warrior
(Dominion)
